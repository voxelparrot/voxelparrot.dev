  "extendedDescription": "# **_Cognata Remaster_**\n### A polished survival multiplayer modpack, with extremely advanced progression, civilization building aspects, and warfare!\n\nThis modpack is **highly HIGHLY recommended** to play in multiplayer. I do not recommend playing this in singleplayer.\n\nCognata is designed in such a way where **you can pretty much progress to any point anywhere just by using the materials around you**, until you want to craft artifacts. This style of progression is great for multiplayer dynamics, especially for anarchy and factions servers (Originally Cognata was played on a factions server).\n\n---\n\n## **üìã Tutorial**\n\nüìö When playing Cognata Remaster, it's important to know that **most of the recipes** in the modpack can be found in the **EMI recipe book**. Because of the difference from vanilla progression, certain parts of the modpack could be unintuitive for some.\n\n---\n\n## **üóíÔ∏è Content**\n\nüõ†Ô∏è Progress through many stages of materials, from primitive wooden tools bound with pitch glue, to the precisely crafted gem age, all the way to the fantasy-like metals of skysteel and shadowsteel alloys. Mods such as **Create**, **Farmer's Delight**, **More Ores More Gems**, and even **Twigs** have been integrated into progression and carefully attuned to complement each other in a polished-feeling way.\n\n‚úàÔ∏è Cognata Remaster also integrates mods such as **Immersive Aircraft** and **Waystones** into its progression while keeping both methods of transport balanced with each other and other vanilla methods of transport.\n\nüè† As well as material progression, Cognata Remaster also introduces an alternate path with similar power having to do with creating your own civilization and cities! In Cognata, the player can literally raise a village from the soil. You can create villagers from clay and specialize them into warriors, farmers, archers, captains, miners, and much, much more. Cognata Remaster expands on this concept, improving on villager workstations by giving them **new models** and adding new **Horde Moon** events to defend your village from.\n\nüå≥ On top of these changes in progression, both world generation and entity behavior have changed! You can now find many new biomes across the world. Mobs are now smarter and are more formidable enemies. You might also notice that certain mob types have unique relationships with other mobs, giving the world a more natural feel.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π Healing has been made somewhat more difficult in favor of allowing the player to heal faster when nearby campfires or when sleeping.\n\nüõ†Ô∏è Also, yes, crafting now takes time. I know that sounds bad, but it isn't very long ‚Äî and trust me when I say that it really adds to the genuine feel of the pack.\n\n---\n\n Please check out the original Cognata! It is very cool and without it this pack would not exist.\n",
