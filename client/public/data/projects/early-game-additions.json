  "extendedDescription": "# \uD83C\uDF33 Early Game Additions\nis a mod that adds content for modpack developers to use to add depth to their early game!\n\n### IMPORTANT!\nThis mod was originally made for the **Cognata** modpack, so its _original_ recipes require items from mods such as Create, Farmer's Delight and Twigs. However, these are marked as _optional_ dependencies because modpack developers can use datapacks or tools like CraftTweaker to change these recipes for their own.\n\n## \uD83D\uDDD2\uFE0F Content\n- Three stages of tree tap items (crude wood, copper, iron)\n- New crude wooden axe and shovel craftable in the inventory\n- Sap and Pitch Glue\n- A few extra advancements for vanilla and create (advancement for diamond pickaxe, crafting table, wooden pickaxe, etc) to supplement a slower rate of progression\n- Blowtorch\n\nYou can use this mod in your modpacks!\n",
