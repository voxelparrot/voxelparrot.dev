You are also able to craft **golden blaze statues** to summon blazes.\n\nThe unfired figures are crafted using clay, and firing the figures takes about one minute in a blast furnace.\n\n>Important note: the firing only works in a blast furnace.\n\nUpon right click on a block with at least two non-solid blocks above it, the figure will be placed and spawn the mob.",
